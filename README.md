BetterBlockOutline is a client sided Minecraft mod that allows for ample customization of the block outline. Everything from color customization to debug information.

There are different color effects you can apply to the fill color or the outline color. Chroma, blink, and more coming!

[MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib) is required run and [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for configuration.
