# BetterBlockOutline

BetterBlockOutline is a mod designed to overhaul the block outline from Vanilla Minecraft. There are many ways to change the appearance of the outline. Outline color, width, fill color, see through, and more.

There are different color effects you can apply to the fill color or the outline color. Chroma, blink, and more coming!

[MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib) is required run and [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for configuration.
